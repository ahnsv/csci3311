# Principle

For this project we need to consider these:
- This is a part of data visualization class, so we need to think about what is a good data visualization.
- For every widget or visualization snippet, think user first. What will they expect from this part? What information is helpful to understand the story? 

## Design
Make this look like a decent newyork times article with interactive and eye-catching visualization.
